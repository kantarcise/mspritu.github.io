In the context of this project state-of-the-art real-time deep object detectors are adopted to mobile phones. It is aimed to improve the stand alone performance of these algorithms by using data acquired by mobile sensor. Current version is designed for [TinyYOLOv3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02767) object detector enhanced by the acceleretor data but the algorithm can be easily generalized to other methods. 

The performance of the integrated object detector is inspected under a new dataset, referred as "Mobile Video Dataset". 720p 30 fps videos 
were recorded from different classes such as person, car, cat & dog. The link for this dataset can be found [here.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgOtgHJGJuaJt6EPJt9RX4-amDhORjVEm)
