In this project we have developed a digital audio content identification system that enables on-line monitoring
of multiple radio/TV channels. The proposed system consists of two main modules: "Digital audio watermarking" module
and "audio fingerprinting" module. In order to obtain high identification accuracy, spread spectrum techniques
will be used in the design of the modules.
 

The designed watermark (WM) encoder is a nonlinear data adaptive system that minimizes false alarm ratio by
adaptively controlling the Watermark-to-Signal Ratio. Furthermore the conventional correlator decoder is modified
in such a way that integrating synchronization and WM extraction into one processing step resulting in an on-line
decoding scheme suitable to audio broadcast monitoring. Unlike the existing systems, a classifier-based WM decoder
that models audio watermark decoding as a three class classification problem is also introduced. This allows not
only extraction of embedded watermark bits but also discrimination of unwatermarked audio clips.
