Recently, the studies for digitizing the paintings and storing them in databases are becoming widespread.
Automatic identification of art movements for digital paintings and, in addition to their extracted features,
automatic labelling of paintings with their proper art movements for indexing and storing processes are significant
improvements  in the construction of online museums.

ARTHISTORIAN project deals with the automatic extraction of features of paintings' art movements such as classicism,
impressionism and cubism; and introduces a system developed for the classification and indexing of paintings based on
their art movements. A six dimensional feature set is proposed for the representation of content and it is shown that
the feature set enables to highlight art movements efficiently. In the classifier design, statistical pattern recognition
approach is exploited and a classification accuracy of over 90% is achieved with very small false alarm ratios.
ARTHISTORIAN also offers a quick query based database search and indexing interface and ready to used at museums
and exhibition centres.
